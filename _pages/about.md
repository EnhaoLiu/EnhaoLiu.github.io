Hi, I'm Enhao Liu, a Senior Data Scientist at the University of Maryland Medical System, with a PhD in Operations Research and a focus on building enterprise scale analytics systems in healthcare. My work sits at the intersection of data science, software engineering, and decision science, spanning machine learning, optimization, simulation, and large scale data platforms.

I design end-to-end analytics architectures, from real-time EMR data pipelines and modeling infrastructure to production AI systems that support clinical and operational decision making across hospitals. I have led the development of predictive, prescriptive, and simulation based models used for patient flow optimization, discharge planning, capacity management, and system wide clinical and operational initiatives.

Beyond modeling, I focus on system architecture, scalability, and execution. I work closely with engineering, product, and clinical partners to align technical design with real world workflows, modernize data infrastructure, and translate complex analytics into reliable and maintainable systems. I value clear technical communication, mentorship, and thoughtful system design, and I am motivated by building analytics platforms that improve how complex healthcare organizations operate both clinically and operationally.


<!-- Hi, I'm Enhao Liu. I received my Ph.D. in Industrial and Systems Engineering from the Ohio State University and B.S. in Electric Engineering from Jinan University in China. My research interests span three main areas: supervised & unsupervised machine learning, model-based reinforcement learning, and simulation modeling. I'm currently serving as the Healthcare Data Scientist at the University of Maryland Medical System, and I'm working as part of a team of scientists and engineers that develop and manage predictive (machine learning and deep learning) and prescriptive (mathematical optimization and simulation) analytic models in support of the organization's clinical, operations and business initiatives and priorities. -->

<!-- I am a last-year Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research at the Ohio State University (OSU) under the supervision of [Dr. Theodore Allen](https://ise.osu.edu/people/allen.515) in the Security and Efficiency Through Analytics Laboratory ([SEAL](http://www.blying.com/)). I have been working as a Graduate Research Assistant under the supervision of Dr. Theodore Allen starting from August 2016 on several real-world data-driven applications and academic researches. Since May 2020, I have been also working as a Graduate Research Assistant at OSU for the COVID-19 Comprehensive Monitoring under the supervision of [Dr. Elisabeth Root](https://u.osu.edu/root.145/) and [Dr. Ayaz Hyder](https://cph.osu.edu/people/ahyder). Specifically, my research experience spans two main areas: model-based reinforcement learning and supervised machine learning, and application experience mainly focuses on (1) the cost-effective cybersecurity maintenance policy development based on (Partially Observable) Markov decision processes; (2) cyber vulnerability risk prediction with social media indications based on machine learning models; (3) anomaly detection in the oil & gas pipelines based on machine learning models; and (4) COVID-19 surveillance development. -->
