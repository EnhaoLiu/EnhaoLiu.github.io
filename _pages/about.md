Hi, I'm Enhao Liu. I am a last-year Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research with minors in machine learning and cybersecurity at the Ohio State University under the supervision of Professor Theodore T. Allen in the Security and Efficiency Through Analytics Laboratory ([SEAL](http://www.blying.com/)). I have been working with Professor Theodore T. Allen as a graduate research assistant starting from Aug. 2016 on several real-world data-driven applications and academic researches. Specifically, my experience spans four main areas: cyber security analytics, social media analytics, model-based reinforcement learning, and supervised machine learning.
