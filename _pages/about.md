Hi, I'm Enhao Liu. I am a last-year Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research at the Ohio State University (OSU) under the supervision of [Dr. Theodore Allen](https://ise.osu.edu/people/allen.515) in the Security and Efficiency Through Analytics Laboratory ([SEAL](http://www.blying.com/)). I have been working as a Graduate Research Assistant under the supervision of Dr. Theodore Allen starting from August 2016 on several real-world data-driven applications and academic researches. Since May 2020, I have been also working as a Graduate Research Assistant at OSU for the COVID-19 Comprehensive Monitoring under the supervision of [Dr. Elisabeth Root](https://u.osu.edu/root.145/) and [Dr. Ayaz Hyder](https://cph.osu.edu/people/ahyder). Specifically, my research experience spans two main areas: model-based reinforcement learning and supervised machine learning, and application experience mainly focuses on (1) the cost-effective cybersecurity maintenance policy development based on (Partially Observable) Markov decision processes; (2) cyber vulnerability risk prediction with social media indications based on machine learning models; (3) anomaly detection in the oil & gas pipelines based on machine learning models; and (4) COVID-19 surveillance development.
