Hi, I'm Enhao Liu. I am a last-year Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research with minors in machine learning and cybersecurity at The Ohio State University under the supervision of Professor [Theodore T. Allen](https://ise.osu.edu/people/allen.515) in the Security and Efficiency Through Analytics Laboratory ([SEAL](http://www.blying.com/)). I have been working as a Graduate Research Assistant starting from Aug. 2016 on several real-world data-driven applications and academic researches funded by National Foundation Science. Specifically, my experience spans four main areas: cyber security analytics, social media analytics, model-based reinforcement learning, and supervised machine learning.
