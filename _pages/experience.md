Recent Research Experience
======
* Sep 2020 - May 2021: _Advanced AI in Pipeline Anomaly Classification_ 
  * Team Leader, Funded by ROSEN Group
  * Supervisor: Dr. Theodore Allen
    * Leveraged multiple image processing methods including wavelet transformation, saliency detection, contrast calculation, and blob detection methods to generate over 20 new features for the scanning data of oil & gas pipelines.
    * Achieved over 95% precision & recall for unseen testing data in the proposed machine learning model with hyperparameters optimization.

* Apr 2020 - May 2021: _COVID-19 Comprehensive Monitoring Team at OSU_ 
  * Lead Developer
  * Supervisor: Dr. Elisabeth Root, Dr. Ayaz Hyder
    * Led the full infrastructure of the R Shiny-based dashboard (over 40,000 code lines) of the COVID-19 surveillance for the Ohio Department of Health, including data architecture, software developments, translating requirements, infrastructure design, and implementation. Public-facing site is available: [link]({https://enhaoliu.shinyapps.io/covid-surveillance/).
    * Developed a school-level COVID-19 surveillance tool called [COVID-19 Analytics and Targeted Surveillance System (CATS)](https://news.osu.edu/ohio-state-experts-create-covid-19-surveillance-tool-for-schools/) for over 20 school districts to facilitate superintendents to make learning mode schedules for over 300 schools, 180,000 students, and 20,000 staffs. One of the public-facing dashboards is available on the website of the Hilliard City School District: [link](https://www.hilliardschools.org/20-21/covid-19-dashboard/).


* May 2019 - Mar 2021: _Explainable AI Study - Optimal Classification Tree_ 
  * Graduate Research Assistant, NSF Grant #1912166
  * Supervisor: Dr. Theodore Allen
    * Developed the Python & R package for the optimal classification tree (OCT) algorithm based on mixed-integer linear programming, which supports Gurobi, CPLEX, and GLPK solvers.
    * Applied OCT to the defects classification in pipelines and showed that OCT is comparable to the ensemble learning tree models (such as XGBoost) in terms of model accuracy (96% precision & recall).
