Recent Research Experience
======
* Sep 2020 - Present: _Advanced AI in Pipeline Anomaly Classification_ 
  * Team Leader, Funded by ROSEN Group
  * Supervisor: Dr. Theodore Allen
    * Leveraged multiple image processing methods including wavelet transformation, saliency detection, contrast calculation, and blob detection methods to generate over 20 new features for the scanning data of oil & gas pipelines.
    * Achieved over 95% precision & recall for unseen testing data in the proposed machine learning model with hyperparameters optimization.

* May 2020 - Present: _COVID-19 Comprehensive Monitoring Team at OSU_ 
  * Lead Developer
  * Supervisor: Dr. Elisabeth Root, Dr. Ayaz Hyder
    * Led the full infrastructure of the R Shiny-based dashboard (over 40,000 code lines) of the COVID-19 surveillance for the Ohio Department of Health, including data architecture, software developments, translating requirements, infrastructure design, and implementation. Public-facing site is available: [link]({https://enhaoliu.shinyapps.io/covid-surveillance/).
    * Developed a school-level COVID-19 surveillance tool called [COVID-19 Analytics and Targeted Surveillance System (CATS)](https://news.osu.edu/ohio-state-experts-create-covid-19-surveillance-tool-for-schools/) for over 20 school districts to facilitate superintendents to make learning mode schedules for over 300 schools, 180,000 students, and 20,000 staffs. One of the public-facing dashboards is available on the website of the Hilliard City School District: [link](https://www.hilliardschools.org/20-21/covid-19-dashboard/).


* May 2019 - Present: _Explainable AI Study - Optimal Classification Tree_ 
  * Team Leader, NSF Grant #1912166
  * Supervisor: Dr. Theodore Allen
    * Developed the Python & R package for the optimal classification tree (OCT) algorithm based on mixed-integer linear programming, which supports Gurobi, CPLEX, and GLPK solvers.
    * Applied OCT to the defects classification in pipelines and showed that OCT is comparable to the ensemble learning tree models (such as XGBoost) in terms of model accuracy (96% precision & recall). 
    

* July 2019 - Mar 2020: _Twitter-based Detection for Cyber Vulnerabilities_ 
  * Team Leader, NSF Grant #1912166
  * Supervisor: Dr. Theodore Allen
    * Wrote scraping scripts using Python to collect recent five-year Twitter data (millions of tweets) and other online resources about 70,000 distinct software vulnerabilities spanned over 9,000 different vendors.
    * Developed feature generation and classification models to early detect exploited vulnerabilities based on supervised machine learning methods using scikit-learn framework.


    
* Aug 2016 - Nov 2018: _Cyber Vulnerabilities Maintenance Management_ 
  * Team Leader, NSF Grant #1409214
  * Supervisor: Dr. Theodore Allen
    * Implemented comprehensive procedures using R to process and statistically analyze 2.3 million scanned data about vulnerabilities spanned about 50,000 hosts at the Ohio State University, which facilitated the development of data-driven cyber vulnerability maintenance. 
    * Developed a novel framework based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes to derive cost-effective cyber vulnerability maintenance policies that address the incomplete inspection issue on 50,000 multi-type hosts.
    * Worked with Dr. Theodore Allen and a Ph.D. candidate Sayak Roychowdhury to develop a new Monte Carlo-Bayesian Reinforcement Learning framework to address parameters uncertainty in model-based Markov Decision Processes in which multiple identical-systems have been considered.
    * Collaborated with Dr. Theodore Allen and a graduate student Akshay K. Murali to build simulation models in ARENA to evaluate the cyber maintenance policies under different scenarios in terms of maintenance costs and security hardening.
    
    
* Mar 2019: _Scholarly Publication Network Exploration_
  * Team Leader
  * Supervisor: Dr. Theodore Allen
    * Created a visualized and interactive network using R to depict the publication associations among the scholars and their co-authors who are in the section of INFORMS Social Media Analytics (SMA), which presented in the Newsletter of the section of INFORMS SMA in 2019.
