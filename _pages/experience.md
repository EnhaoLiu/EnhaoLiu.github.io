Recent Research Experience
======
* July 2019 - Present: Twitter-based Detection for Cyber Vulnerabilities (in progress)
  * Team Leader, NSF Grant #1912166
  * Supervisor: Theodore T. Allen
    * Wrote scraping scripts using Python to collect recent five-year Twitter data and other online resources about 70,000 distinct software vulnerabilities spanned over 9,000 different vendors.
    * Developed feature generation and classification models to early detect exploited vulnerabilities based on supervised machine learning methods using scikit-learn framework.

* May 2019 - Present: Explainable AI Study: Optimal Classification Tree(in progress)
  * Team Leader, NSF Grant #1912166
  * Supervisor: Theodore T. Allen
    * Wrote the first R package for the algorithm of optimal classification tree based on mixed-integer linear programming, which will be used to generate detection rules for distinguishing compromised email accounts.
    
    
* Aug 2016 - Nov 2018: Cyber Vulnerabilities Maintenance Management (major)
  * Team Leader, NSF Grant #1409214
  * Supervisor: Theodore T. Allen
    * Implemented comprehensive procedures using R to process and statistically analyze 2.3 million scanned data about vulnerabilities spanned about 50,000 hosts at the Ohio State University, which facilitated the development of data-driven cyber vulnerability maintenance. 
    * Developed a novel framework based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes to derive cyber vulnerability maintenance policies that address the incomplete inspection issue on 50,000 multi-type hosts.
    * Worked with Professor Theodore T. Allen and a Ph.D. candidate Sayak Roychowdhury to develop a new Monte Carlo-Bayesian Reinforcement Learning framework to address parameters uncertainty in model-based Markov Decision Processes in which multiple identical-systems have been considered.
    * Collaborated with Professor Theodore T. Allen and a graduate student Akshay K. Murali to build simulation models in ARENA to evaluate the cyber maintenance policies under different scenarios in terms of maintenance costs and security hardening.
    

       
* Mar 2019: Scholarly Publication Network Exploration (minor)
  * Team Leader
  * Supervisor: Theodore T. Allen
    * Created a visualized and interactive network using R to depict the publication associations among the scholars and their co-authors who are in the section of INFORMS Social Media Analytics (SMA), which presented in the Newsletter of the section of INFORMS SMA in 2019.
    
        
Employment
======
* Aug 2016 - Present: Graduate Research Assistant
  * The Ohio State University
  * Department: Integrated Systems Engineering; Lab: Security and Efficiency Through Analytics Laboratory
  * Supervisor: Theodore T. Allen
    * Led the project "A Framework For Economical Cyber Security Inspection and Assurance" funded by National Science Foundation (NSF Grant #1912166) starting from May 2019.
    * Led and conducted the project "Data-Driven Cyber Vulnerability Maintenance" funded by National Science Foundation (NSF Grant #1409214) from Aug 2016 to Nov 2018.
    * Worked with Professor Theodore T. Allen to design a new syllabus and materials for a course "Introduction to Operations Analytics" which will be offered in Spring 2020. The new version of this course is aimed to help undergraduate and graduate students learn how to implement industrial applications using R and Python.

* May 2016 - Aug 2016: Student Associate
  * The Ohio State University
  * Department: Integrated Systems Engineering; Lab: Security and Efficiency Through Analytics Laboratory
  * Supervisor: Theodore T. Allen
    * Collaborated with a graduate student Tianyu Jiang to develop a software using VB.NET to produce data-driven cyber vulnerabilities maintenance policies for about 50,000 hosts at the Ohio State University.
